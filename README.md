## About Me
Hi, I’m Renelle.
I’m a Business Intelligence & Data Analytics professional with a background in project administration and public-sector programme support, currently transitioning into a data-driven role focused on insight, impact, and decision-making.

My work sits at the intersection of data, strategy, and development. I’m especially interested in how clean, well-structured data can be used to improve programme performance support evidence-based policy and funding decisions, and strengthen accountability in mission-driven organisations.

I have experience working with large Excel datasets, Power BI, and Tableau, and I enjoy turning messy, real-world data into clear, usable insights. Many of my projects reflect practical constraints—limited systems, manual reporting, and evolving data maturity—which mirrors the environments I’m workin in.

This GitHub serves as a record of my learning, projects, and applied work as I continue to grow in Business Intelligence
